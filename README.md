It allows users to securely store, deposit, and withdraw tokens while providing additional functionalities such as token staking and time-locked releases. The platform features a secure backend and an intuitive frontend, integrated with MetaMask for seamless user interaction. Smart contracts manage token deposits, withdrawals, and staking rewards, ensuring automatic execution and transparent transactions.
